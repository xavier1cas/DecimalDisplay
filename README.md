# Decimal_Display
This is a verilog implementation of the Double Dabble algorithm with solely Combinational Logic, the algorithm is fully parametrized to an arbitrary N number of input bits and a D number of decimal displays.
The Double Babble algorithm takes an unsigned binary number and converts it to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD).
